## Overview of Project
An analysis of existing CitiBike ridership in New York City to be used to demonstrate the viability of such a service in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

One outcome of this analysis shows that for all rides taken during the month of August, the overhwleming majority were for a very short ride.

Further analysis supports this theory.  If we review all rides to show the most popular starting and ending locations within NYC, we can see that the bulk of the riders use the same stations a majority of the time.  This would indicate that the rides are short distance and short time.

Another interesting outcome of the analysis shows a clear pattern in ridership based on the day of the week.  Peak ridership during weekdays coincides heavily with use during the start and end of the traditional 8 hour workday.  However, on the weekends the ridership appears to be more evenly spread throughout the daylight hours, implying that the ridership could be more leisure-based, rather than being driven by a daily work commute.

Finally, we reviewed a number of both usertype and gender-based statistics. The habits of riders, whether Male, Female, or undefined/unknown genders, line up cleanly with the data from previous graphics, showing that there is no clear trend among rider habits based on gender.

Further, the vast majority of the userbase are riderts who subscribe the service, and among those most of the users are male.  The data show that Most of the subscribers to Citi Bike are the ones driving the commute-based data points from the previous graphics.  Though not as pronounced, it appears that the leisure uses from the weekend use are more typically one-time customers, or otherwise those who choose not to subscribe to the service.

## Summary
In short, it's clear that the main userbase consists of male subscribers and that the majority of the rides are very short both spatially and temporally. However, because we are looking to expand the market to Des Moines, IA, limited the data analsyis purely to the currrent Citi Bike ridership in New York City is not enough to determine the viability of such a service in a different city.  Further analysis should include a comparison of the demographics between the cities of Des Moines, IA and NYC, NY to determine what percent of the population in NYC is using the service, how the population of Des Moines compares to that of NYC, and from there attempt to reach a logical conclusion as to what level of ridership one could theoretically expect from the service, should it be itntrioduced in Des Monies.  

Further, the current extent of the analysis does not address the land use and existing infrastructure differences that may exist between Des Moines and NYC.  Another important analysis should attempt to discern how ridership in NYC, a very compact city, might translate over to Des Moines, which at a a glance does not apepar to have as many businesses and residences as tightly packed together as they are in large city like NYC.  If Des Moines users have to travel further to reach their desired destination, based on what we understand about the typical ridership in NYC, expanding to Des Moines might not be viable, it may need to be scaled down accordingly, and/or perhaps rebranded to attract a different demographic.

While the existing NYC data paints a very positive picture of the viability of the service, these and more analyses should be conducted before attempting to expand to another market based entirely on the success in one of the worlds largest metropolises.
